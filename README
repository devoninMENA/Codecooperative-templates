##Overview

I *suck* at github, but I see using GIT as a wave of the future, and so this repository was born as a way for me (and some clever friends) to practice version control, and refine the way I do web development by honing my processes with friends. This is a collection of boilerplates that I use for web development, from the initial discovery/prototyping phase to the final deployment. Feel free to remix and reuse anything you'd like; that's how everything here exists : )
