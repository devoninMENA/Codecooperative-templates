##Content

Content, the textual and visual makeup of a site, is essential to a good design.
 
I will add the content provided by you to the site. If additional content is needed to complete the above pages/features, you will supply the content in a timely matter, or agree to a delayed launch of the site.
Revisions

Your vision, insight, and personality are key to the process of making a great site. Agreeing on a set number of revisions honors the unique elements we both bring to the project and helps us launch the site on time. 

Once you select a design from the three options I will provide, you are entitled to make two rounds of revision to the design of the site. Additional revisions will be handled on a case-by-case basis and subject to additional costs.
Cancellation 

Cancellation is not fun, and hopefully this is something we won’t have to deal with. In the event that we do: 

We need to agree — in writing — to cancel the project. 

Once we’ve signed this contract, the initial deposit is non-refundable, except in cases deemed acceptable by me. 

##Compatibility

I will develop HTML5 markup and CSS templates using HTML5 and CSS2.1 and CSS3 for styling. The landscape of web browsers and devices changes regularly and my approach is to look forward, not back. With that in mind I will test all markup and CSS in current versions of all major desktop browsers. Users of older or less capable browsers or devices will experience a design that is appropriate to the capabilities of their software. For people using Microsoft Internet Explorer 6, this means a universal, typographically focussed design but no layout. I will also test that these templates perform well on Apple’s iPad.

I will not test these templates in old or abandoned browsers such as previous versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer (e.g. IE 6), Safari, Firefox, and Opera unless otherwise specified. Any request to accommodate these browsers will be charged at a project-defined rate.

##Maintenance 

Website maintenance includes backing up a site’s files and database, as well as performance tuning and security checks. 

I am not responsible for maintenance of the site after it has been completed to the specifications listed above. I will provide you with copies of all site materials on completion of the site, and it is your responsibility to maintain any backups after that (ideally spread out over at least two locations). 

You may request that I perform necessary maintenance tasks, but all such requests are subject to additional fees on a project or month-to-month basis. 


##Copyright

You guarantee to me that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork that you provide for inclusion in the website are either owned by you or that you have permission to use them

When I receive your final payment, copyright is automatically assigned as follows:

You own the graphics and other visual elements that I create for you for this project. I will give you a copy of all files and you should store them in a safe place, as I am not required to keep them or provide any native source files that were used in making them.

You also own text content, photographs, and any data for which you initially held the copyright.  I own the HTML markup, CSS, and other code, and I license it to you for use on only this site.

I take pride in my work, and I love to share it, so I  reserve the right to display and link to your completed project as part of my portfolio and to write about the project on websites, in magazine articles, and in books about web design (forthcoming, of course).

##My Thanks


I hope this document has helped to clarify, not confuse, how we are going to complete this project. Please contact me with any questions; I look forward to working with you!
